# Welcome to Simple Icons Python Integration

The script is based on the
[simpleicons python package](https://github.com/sachinraja/simple-icons-py)
and simplepycons package

You can refer to their documentation and the
website of
[Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) for more
information

The ICON_DIR environment variable provides the
location of the folder where you want to store the
icons for later use. I have stored it in the .env
file and loaded it when running the script. This
.env is not committed to the repo.
